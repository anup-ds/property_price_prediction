# Property Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A data science project aimed at predicting real-estate property prices based on multiple housing features such as location, area, number of rooms, construction status, and amenities.
The model helps estimate accurate property prices to support buyers, sellers, and real-estate businesses in making data-driven decisions.

 Key Features:

End-to-End ML Pipeline – Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

EDA Insights – Visualization of trends in price distribution, area-wise variation, and construction status impact.

Model Used – Implemented advanced algorithms including LightGBM, achieving high predictive accuracy.

Web App Integration – Built an interactive Streamlit application for real-time property price prediction.

Reusable Code – Modular Python scripts and notebook for easy retraining on new datasets.

🧠 Tech Stack
