# Property Price Prediction using Machine Learning

A data science project aimed at predicting real-estate property prices based on multiple housing features such as location, area, number of rooms, construction status, and amenities.
The model helps estimate accurate property prices to support buyers, sellers, and real-estate businesses in making data-driven decisions.

 **Key Features:**

End-to-End ML Pipeline – Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

EDA Insights – Visualization of trends in price distribution, area-wise variation, and construction status impact.

Model Used – Implemented advanced algorithms including LightGBM, achieving high predictive accuracy.

Web App Integration – Built an interactive Streamlit application for real-time property price prediction.

Reusable Code – Modular Python scripts and notebook for easy retraining on new datasets.

**Tech Stack:**

Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, LightGBM, Joblib, Streamlit

Environment: Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit App

Version Control: Git & GitHub

**Project Workflow:**

Data Collection & Cleaning – Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding correlations and feature importance.

Feature Engineering – Encoding categorical variables and scaling numeric ones.

Model Training & Evaluation – Comparing regression models; finalizing LightGBM.

Deployment – Streamlit-based web interface for user input and live predictions.

Results

Achieved high model accuracy on test data with minimal error metrics.

The deployed Streamlit app predicts property prices instantly from user inputs.
